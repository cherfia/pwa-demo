This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Scheduled Notifications

This app supports scheduling push notifications that will be sent even if the app is closed. Notifications are scheduled using [Upstash QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted), a serverless message queue with built-in scheduling.

### Setup

1. **Get QStash credentials:**

   - Sign up at [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) (free tier available)
   - Create a QStash project
   - Copy your QStash token

2. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   QSTASH_TOKEN=your_qstash_token_here
   ```

   Optional (for production security):

   ```bash
   QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=your_signing_key
   QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=your_next_signing_key
   ```

3. **Set your base URL** (for production):
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```

### How It Works

- When you schedule a notification, it's sent to QStash with a delay
- QStash calls your API endpoint at the scheduled time
- No cron jobs needed - QStash handles all scheduling
- Works on any hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Free tier includes 10,000 requests/month

### Local Development

For local development, QStash requires a publicly accessible URL. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or similar:

```bash
# Start your dev server
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, expose it with ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the ngrok URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io) and set it:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

### Troubleshooting

If notifications aren't being received:

1. **Check QStash logs**: Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/) → QStash → Logs to see if messages are being scheduled and delivered.

2. **Verify environment variables**:

   ```bash
   QSTASH_TOKEN=your_token
   QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=your_key
   QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=your_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com  # Must be publicly accessible
   ```

3. **Check server logs**: Look for console logs showing:

   - "Scheduling notification with QStash"
   - "QStash callback received"
   - Any error messages

4. **Check QStash delivery status**: In [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/) → QStash → Logs:
   - Look for your message ID
   - Check the "Status" column - should be "Delivered" (green) or show an error
   - Click on a message to see the full request/response details
   - Check the HTTP status code returned by your endpoint

5. **Verify the endpoint is accessible**: Test your endpoint manually:

   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/notifications/send-scheduled
   ```

6. **Test push notifications directly**: Use the test endpoint to verify your subscription works:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/notifications/test \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"subscription": {...your subscription...}, "message": "Test"}'
   ```

7. **Check Vercel function logs**: If deployed on Vercel, check the function logs in the Vercel dashboard for:
   - "QStash callback received"
   - "Sending push notification"
   - Any error messages

8. **Common issues**:
   - **Signature verification failing**: Make sure `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` are set correctly
   - **Subscription expired**: The subscription might have expired between scheduling and delivery
   - **Invalid subscription format**: Check that the subscription object structure is correct when passed to QStash
   - **Endpoint returning 500**: Check server logs for the actual error

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
